{title:Blowin' in the Wind}
How many [C]roads must a [G]man walk down
Be[G]fore you [C]call him a [D]man
[G]How many [C]seas must the [G]white dove sail
Be[G]fore she [C]sleeps in the [D]sand
And [G]how many [C]times must the [G]cannonballs fly
Be[G]fore they're [C]forever [D]banned

{start_of_chorus}
The [C]answer my [D]friend is [G]blowin' in the [Em]wind
The [C]answer is [D]blowin' in the [G]wind
